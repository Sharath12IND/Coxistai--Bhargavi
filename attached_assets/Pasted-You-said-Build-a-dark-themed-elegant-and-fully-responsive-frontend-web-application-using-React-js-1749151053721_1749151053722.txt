Build a dark-themed, elegant, and fully responsive frontend web application using React.js v18.2.0 named Coexist Ai — an AI-powered education assistant for students.

✅ Design Aesthetic:

Use a professional dark UI theme:

Primary Background: #0f0f1a

Component Cards: #21223a

Accent Blue: #3a86ff

Mint Green: #06d6a0

Text: #ffffff (primary), #b0bec5 (secondary)

Apply glassmorphism and soft glow effects for buttons and cards.

Typography: Clean, rounded sans-serif font. Ensure high contrast readability.

✅ 3D Animated Background:

Add animated 3D cubes, tetrahedrons, spheres, math symbols (∑, ∫, π) floating gently in the background.

Use opacity variation (0.2–0.5) and soft movement to avoid distraction.

Use React Router for multi-page routing.

Add a sticky top navigation bar with smooth scroll and active link highlights.

Each feature is on its own dedicated page with clean layout and animations.
